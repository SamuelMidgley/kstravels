And these are the only photos they took of us ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ Setting off from the beach there was huge waves and everyone apart from us capsized (big flex) although i was thrown in the air a few times, (i wish i had a video of it, was rly funny), also we saw loads of dolphins, it was incredible, highlight of the trip so far</p>
