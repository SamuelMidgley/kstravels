        <p>Hello hello,</p>
        <p>We‚Äôre about to embark on a big adventure‚Ä¶heading up the east coast!! currently sat at the coach station waiting for a greyhound to take us to Sydney‚Ä¶on a 12 hour journey üòµ‚Äçüí´ manifesting being able to sleep the whole way.</p>
        <p>Luckily, it‚Äôs now october which means avoiding the possibility of magpie swooping!! we‚Äôve been extra paranoid walking around because it‚Äôs magpie mating season, and they‚Äôre known to attack walkers/cyclists on the street.</p>
        <p>We‚Äôve had a pretty busy week this week, i was ill monday so we had a chill day in the flat watching below deck (shock). the colds almost gone now woo!</p>
