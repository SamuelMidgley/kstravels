        We went on a kayaking dolphin tour, they told us they take photos so we
        thought best to not take our phones. And these are the only photos they
        took of us ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ Setting off from the beach there was huge waves and
        everyone apart from us capsized (big flex) although i was thrown in the
        air a few times, (i wish i had a video of it, was rly funny), also we
        saw loads of dolphins, it was incredible, highlight of the trip so far
