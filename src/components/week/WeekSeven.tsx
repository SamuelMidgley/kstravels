        Magnetic island!! pretty close to what i imagine heaven&apos;s like
        (except without the snakes etc). it was just chill chill vibes, the
        hostel we stayed in was camping/cabins v v nice. it had its own lil
        wildlife reserve and we got to go and see some animals! sam held a snake
        but i was like hell no i ain't going near it
      </p>
      <p>
        We were staying at Selina hostel which was so cool there were kangaroos
        and wallabies just chilling everywhere
      </p>
