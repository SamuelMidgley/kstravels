      <p>Kia ora koutou (Hello everyone)</p>
      <p>
        Let's just ignore the fact it's been just over a month since the last
        update...
      </p>
      <h2>Kaiteriteri</h2>
      <p>
        Our first stop on the south island was Kaiteriteri right on the border
        of the Abel Tasman national park. So it only makes sense to play mini
        golf right??
      </p>
      <Figure src={golf} caption="Kiara 'Tiger Woods' Sagoo" />
      <h2>Westport bestport</h2>
      <p>
        Along the way to Westport we went to Lake Rotoiti Jetty to get that
        iconic jump photo.
      </p>
      <Figure

        caption="No comment on how long this took to get..."
      />
      <p>
        Didn't know what to expect from Westport but it was actually pretty fun.
        Me and Kiara went for a little run (yep I know what you're thinking...
        that's not a typo) and saw some pretty sites.
      </p>
      <Figure src={westport} caption="A lovely view of westport" />
      <p>
        We then ended the day driving past many no fire signs to set up a
        bonfire and have some s'mores.
      </p>
      <Figure src={smores} caption="Please sir can I have some s'more" />
      <h2>Franz Josef</h2>
      <p>
        Wowza this was a beautiful stop. When we got here we took a lil hike to
        the glacier and it is terrifying seeing how far it has retreated in
        recent years #globalwarming #recedingfasterthanmyhairline.
      </p>
      <p>
        On our free day here we started off with a cheeky bit of quad biking.
      </p>

      <p>We then finished the day with a little bit of kayaking</p>

      />
      <p>
        We ended the day with some sightseeing of Franz Josef town and found irl
        Garfield
      </p>

      <h2>Queenstown</h2>
      <p>It was a pretty spectacular drive from Franz Josef to Queenstown.</p>
      <Figure
        src={lakehawea}
        caption="Just looks straight out of a postcard (Lake Hawea)"
      />
      <p>
        Queenstown might honestly be the prettiest city we've ever been to. We
        arrived to a pretty incredible sunset and got a fergburger (a Queenstown
        institute)
      </p>
      <Figure
        src={sunset}
        caption="Definitely one of the sunsets of all time"
      />
      <Figure
        src={fergburger}
        caption="It's actually disgraceful how many of these we got..."
      />
      <p>
        The next day we really went out of our comfort zones and did the
        shotover canyon swing. I can't remember the last time I was that scared
        and judging by Kiara's face she was thinking the same thing.
      </p>

      <h2>Milford Sound</h2>
      <p>
        While in Queenstown we had a hefty 12 hour day trip to Milford Sound
        (actually a Fjord).
      </p>

      <p>
        We got back just in time to do the kiwi experience pub crawl. Big fan of
        a Queenstown night out. There was more dnb and teapots than I was
        expecting but that's never a bad thing.

        Don't worry there won't be as much of a wait til the next blog,
        probably...
