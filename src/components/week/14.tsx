      <h2>Kaiteriteri</h2>
      <p>
        Our first stop on the south island was Kaiteriteri right on the border
        of the Abel Tasman national park. So it only makes sense to play mini
        golf right??
      </p>

      <h2>Westport bestport</h2>
      <p>
        Along the way to Westport we went to Lake Rotoiti Jetty to get that
        iconic jump.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        Didn't know what to expect from Westport but it was actually pretty fun.
        Me and Kiara went for a little run (yep I know what you're thinking...
        that's not a typo) and saw some pretty sites.
      </p>

      <p> We then ended the day with a bonfire and some s'mores.</p>
      <Figure src={smores} caption="Please sir can I have some s'more" />
      <h2>Franz Josef</h2>
      <p>
        Wowza this was a beautiful stop. When we got here we took a lil hike to
        the glacier and it is terrifying seeing how far it has retreated in
        recent years #globalwarming #recedingfasterthanmyhairline.
      </p>
      <p>
        On our free day here we started off with a cheeky bit of quad biking.

      <p>We then finished the day with a little bit of kayaking</p>

      <h2>Queenstown</h2>

      />
      <p>
        It's just getting more and more beautiful. Honestly might be the
        prettiest city we've ever been to. We arrived to a pretty incredible
        sunset and got a fergburger (a Queenstown institute)
      </p>
      <Figure

        caption="Definitely one of the sunsets of all time"

        caption="It's actually disgraceful how many of these we got..."
      />
      <p>
        The next day we really went out of our comfort zones and did the
        shotover canyon swing. I can't remember the last time I was that
        scared...

      <h2>Milford Sound</h2>
      <p>
        While in Queenstown we had a hefty 12 hour day trip to Milford Sound
        (actually a Fjord). Tbh the drive there was more impressive than the
        Fjord but that's more of a compliment of the drive.
      </p>

      <p>
        We got back just in time to do a kiwi experience pub crawl. Big fan of a
        Queenstown night out.
