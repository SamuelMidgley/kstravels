      <p>Hello everybody,</p>
      <p>
        This week we've been traveling all the way down the north island to
        Wellington.
      </p>
      <h2>Hot water beach</h2>
      <p>
        Our first stop was hot water beach. As the name implies there is hot
        water on the beach. We didn't take any photos but gosh darn was it busy
        and surprisingly hot getting up to 64 degrees celsius.
      </p>
      <h2>Waitomo</h2>
      <p>
        The next day we wasted no time and headed straight to Waitomo for the
        famous glowworm caves. Definitely one of the highlights of all our
        travels.
      </p>

      <Figure src={sendit} caption="Just send it bro" alt="" />
      <h2>Rotorua</h2>
      <p>
        No rest for the backpackers so we headed straight to Rotorua. Along the
        way we went to Hobbiton!!
      </p>

      <Figure src={mtvcribs} alt="" caption="Hey MTV welcome to our crib" />
      <p>
        They had just opened up two hobbit holes that you can go into and we got
        a little bit too invested...
      </p>

      <p>
        We then finished off the evening by going to the Mita Maori dining
        experience. It was nice to have a meal that wasn't pasta and it was an
        interesting experience learning a bit about Maori culture.
      </p>

      <h2>Taupo</h2>
      <p>
        Along the way we went rafting down the Kaituna river. We were supposed
        to do the 7m waterfall but that got cancelled due to rain so we did a
        much longer raft which was pretty fun. No photos unfortunately.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        When we got to Taupo the whole Kiwi experience bus went on a Catamaran
        and went for a little sail on Lake Taupo to the Ngatoroirangi Mine Bay
        Maori Rock Carvings.

      <p>
        We also had a little bit of karaoke on the way back but fortunately for
        everyone we "lost" the video of that.

      <p>We then had a free day in Taupo to explore.</p>

      />
      <h2>Wellington</h2>
      <p>
        On the way to wellington we stopped in Tongariro National Park and went
        for a pretty stunning hike (not the alpine crossing tho).

      <p>
        We then spent 3 nights in Wellington and made full use of our hotels spa
        and gym.
