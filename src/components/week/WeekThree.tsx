      <p>Hello hello,</p>
      <p>
        We&apos;re about to embark on a big adventure‚Ä¶heading up the east
        coast!! currently sat at the coach station waiting for a greyhound to
        take us to Sydney‚Ä¶on a 12 hour journey üòµ‚Äçüí´ manifesting being able to
        sleep the whole way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, it&apos;s now october which means avoiding the possibility of
        magpie swooping!! we&apos;ve been extra paranoid walking around because
        it&apos;s magpie mating season, and they&apos;re known to attack
        walkers/cyclists on the street.
      </p>
      <p>
        We&apos;ve had a pretty busy week this week, i was ill monday so we had
        a chill day in the flat watching below deck (shock). the colds almost
        gone now woo!
