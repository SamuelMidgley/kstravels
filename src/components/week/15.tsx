      />
      <h2>Lake Tekapo ‚û° Christchurch</h2>
      <p>
        We spent less than 24 hours here but that was still enough time to say
        bye

      <h2>Kaik≈çura ‚û° Wellington (again)</h2>
      <p>
        We were pretty shattered at this point so you'll be gutted to hear we
        don't have any more photos of the windiest place in New Zealand
      </p>

      <p>
        And that's the end of New Zealand :( It honestly might have been the
        best month of our lives.
