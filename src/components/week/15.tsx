      <p>Hello Samiacs and Kiaranauts,</p>
      <p>
        Strap in because it's the last update from our travels across New
        Zealand.
      </p>
      <h2>Queenstown ‚û° Lake Tekapo</h2>
      <p>Our first stop after Queenstown.</p>
      <Figure
        src={cook}
        caption="If you squint you can see Mount Cook. I promise I didn't put a filter on this, the blueness is due to the surrounding glaciers"
      />
      <Figure
        src={dog}
        caption="This statue was made to appreciate the value of the collie dog. Got me a little emotional, RIP Mac & Idris ‚ù§"
      />
      <Figure
        src={duck}
        caption="Yeah it's a duck ... but he kept eating my food so just wanted to name and shame it"
      />
      <Figure
        src={lupins}
        caption="Some pretty Lupins. You'd be surprised how many accidents these flowers cause with tourists trying to get photos of them"
      />
      <h2>Lake Tekapo ‚û° Christchurch</h2>
      <p>
        We spent less than 24 hours here but that was still enough time to find
        the nearest food market and stay there til it closed #nopainnogain.
      </p>
      <Figure
        src={christchurch}
        caption="Apparently punting is a big thing here. Checks out that Christchurch is the Canterbury district."
      />
      <h2>Christchurch ‚û° Kaik≈çura</h2>
      <Figure
        src={kaikoura}
        caption="You know we love a fun fact here so fun fact... the white land you see is only 10 years old and appeared after the Kaik≈çura earthquake"
      />
      <Figure
        src={lunch}
        caption="Now that is a gorgeous view, Kiara looks nice as well I guess"
      />
      <Figure src={manmakefire} caption="man make fire" />
      <Figure src={fire} caption="this time with fish and chips" />
      <Figure
        src={deep}
        caption="Kiara being the health queen she is got a deep fried brownie, nom nom"
      />
      <h2>Kaik≈çura ‚û° Wellington (again)</h2>
      <p>
        We were pretty shattered at this point so you'll be gutted to hear we
        don't have any more photos of the windiest place in New Zealand.
      </p>
      <Figure
        src={seal}
        caption="On the way to Wellington we did do a nice walk and saw loads of seals. We're not too sure if the seals here are fighting or doing adult things..."
      />
      <h2>Wellington (again) ‚û° Taupo (again)</h2>
      <p>We're back in Taupo which means only one thing, boat partayyyyyy!!!</p>
      <Figure
        src={noodle}
        caption="That's me holding the noodle, no comment on why everyone is swimming away from me"
      />
      <Figure
        src={crazy}
        caption="We managed to break a Kiwi Experience record and be the first people to get kicked out of the bar in Taupo üòé, you'd never have guessed it based off this photo"
      />
      <h2>Taupo ‚û° Auckland</h2>
      <p>The final bus journey of the year.</p>
      <Figure
        src={comfy}
        caption="As you can tell we were well and truly fed up with buses by this point"
      />
      <Figure
        src={jump}
        caption="I dunno why this became a thing, defo a joke that got out of hand, but here's us embarrassing our bus driver Fraser on our last night in Auckland :)"
      />
      <p>
        And that's the end of New Zealand :( It honestly might have been the
        best month of our lives.
      </p>
      <p>On that note ... cya</p>
    </Week>
