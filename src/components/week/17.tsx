      <p>Halo!</p>
      <p>Welcome to the first of the Bali blogs this time written by Kiara</p>
      <h2>Seminyak</h2>
      <Figure src={green} caption="Our first hotel in Bali, so pretty" />
      <p>
        In Seminyak we stayed at a really nice hostel, apart from the fact we
        were two of 5 people staying there LOL we were near a beach called Kuta
        beach, which made me giggle (non punjabi speakers (which does include me
        to be fair) in punjabi its a swear word meaning dog)
      </p>
      <h2>Canggu</h2>
      <p>
        We stayed in a veery nice hotel, because its not peak season like at
        all, we got it half price ðŸ˜Ž we had a traditional balinese massage at
        their spa, which included them yanking on our toes (yes it was as
        painful as it sounds) but the real pain began afterâ€¦ it turns out im
        allergic the massage oil they used!! As I found out when an hour later,
        my whole body erupted in hives. if youâ€™ve watched the second hunger
        games, the bit where they all get stuck in the mist and their skin goes
        all gammy? that was me.
      </p>
