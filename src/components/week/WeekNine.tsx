      <p>G'day mateys</p>
      <p>
        It's a small update from us this week as we've been planning for our
        great ocean road trip and New Zealand adventure we'll be doing this
        month!

      <h2>The Planet Earth Experience</h2>
      <p>
        For the OG Sam and Kiara fans you'll know we went to the LUME for
        "Connection" which was about the art, music and culture of the first
        nations. Well, the same venue was also running a planet earth experience
        so you know we were gonna go there. It showed 10 minutes of footage from
        each continent and was pretty groovy.

      <h2>A trip to Mornington with Will and Lucy</h2>
      <p>
        We finally met up with Will and his girlfriend Lucy and went on a day
        trip to Mornington. Sam continued his Cotton On addiction, we went to
        the pub, and finished the day having some beers in a hot tub. It's a
        hard life down under.

      <h2>You never forget your first (Australian bouldering competition)</h2>
      <p>
        It's been a hot minute since I've "competed" in a climbing competition
        so when better to start again than 2 months into a holiday. I was
        holding strong in the top 30 but DISASTER... a few hours in I noticed
        that I was 33rd. There was only 30 minutes left, my fingers were sore, I
        knew I needed to climb harder than I ever have before. So with every
        ounce of strength I had left I went to the pub and had a burger and a
        schooner.
