      <p>Hellloooooo</p>
      <p>
        This is the final blog post for our east coast travels :(. This week we
        traveled up to our final destination: cairns where we saw the rainforest
        and the great barrier reef which were incredible! The town itself was
        okay, imagine an industrial estate thats been turned into a residential
        area.
      </p>
      <p>Without further ado here's what we got up to:</p>
      <h2>Uncle Brian's fun, falls and forest</h2>
      <p>
        Our first activity led us straight to the rainforest. We saw platypuses,
        flying foxes, turtles and many many tourists.

      <p>
        Our first stop for the day was at Babinda boulders. Fun fact, Babinda is
        Australia's wettest town and records an average annual rainfall in
        excess of 4 metres. This is also where we saw our first wild platypus.

      </figure>
      <p>
        Our second stop was Wooroonooran (try saying that after a couple pints)
        where there is a natural waterslide!
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        Our third stop was at Millaa Millaa Waterfall. You may recognise it from
        Peter Andre's Mysterious girl or the iconic Herbal essence hair flick.
        It's also home to an eel that bit two people on our tour oop. Sam also
        saw a baby turtle here.

      <h2>The Great Barrier Reef</h2>
      <p>
        C'mon, we weren't gonna do the east coast and not go the great barrier
        reef. We had a wonderful day with lots of food and pretty views.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was also a semi submersible tour with a marine biologist, and yes
        the recent submarine implosion was on our mind and it didn't help that
        was a company called ocean gate and we were with ocean spirit.

      <h2>The Great Barrier Reef cont.</h2>
      <p>
        Sam loved his scuba dive so much he went on a lil solo adventure the
        following day to Port Douglas and did 3 dives and saw loads of reef
        sharks. He met a brummy called Tom who took these photos:

      <h2>Kuranda Scenic Railway and Skyrail</h2>
      <p>
        We were embracing our inner OAP on this day. Saw lots of pretty views of
        waterfalls and rainforests. We also met an Austrian lady who had been
        skiing at Turracher Hohe, small world!
