      <p>Hello and welcome to the first blog post on the new website!</p>
      <h2>K'gari (Fraser island)</h2>
      <p>
        Guys its been an adventurous week. We went to K&apos;gari! Also known as
        Fraser Island. We started the day with a whale watching tour and saw a
        mom and her baby with another whale. I think they knew when we
        didn&apos;t have our phones out to take pics because thats when they
        would breach (flip out the water).

      <p>
        We also climbed a massive sand dune, kayaked in a lil river (and got
        stuck on a fallen tree trunk), and went snorkelimg. As soon as we got on
        land I got stung by a wasp/fly thing üò°. Not haps.

      <h2>Airlie beach and the Whitsundays</h2>
      <p>
        We went up to Airlie Beach after, i.e. where the Whitsundays is. We
        skydived and did a beach landing, or in my case, a landing on someone
        elses parachute and nearly took them out oops. We jetskiied and
        snorkeled in the Whitsundays and flew over the Great Barrier Reef in a
        lil plane. I saw a shark (eek) and we saw sting rays when snorkelling,
        aswell as a lot of colourful fish and reef, also a lot of bleached coral

        We spent our final full day in Airlie beach flying over the whitsundays
        and great barrier reef and then rafting over to whitehaven beach
        (Pirates of the Carribean 5 filmed a scene here). Here are some of the
        highlights:
